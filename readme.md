## Roadmap (if I had more time)
- Add 'create new quiz' card to home page at end of quiz grid, or if there is no quiz grid, first on the page.
- Show a success snackbar message on the home page when a quiz is created. add a button to practice that quiz on the snackbar message.
- Handle all errors better
- Success snackbar on quiz creation

## Known Issues
- Error snackbars on 'Create' tab are not dismissible
- Image generation is a little slow (api limitation)
- Image generation might yield generic images if request breaks OpenAI TOS
- Navigation is a little buggy when going from Create to Home and Practice to Home. Takes two taps.
